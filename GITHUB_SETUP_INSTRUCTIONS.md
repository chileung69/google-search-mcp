# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details**:
   - Repository name: `google-search-mcp`
   - Description: `Google Search MCP Server - Provides Google search functionality with intelligent result summarization for AI assistants`
   - Set to **Public** (required for community submission)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Link Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/google-search-mcp.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. **Refresh your GitHub repository page**
2. **Verify all files are uploaded**:
   - README.md
   - package.json
   - src/index.ts
   - LICENSE
   - SUBMISSION.md
   - SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md
   - And all other files

## Step 4: Update Package.json

After creating the repository, update the repository URL in package.json:

```bash
# Edit package.json and replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username
# The repository URL should be: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/google-search-mcp.git
```

## Step 5: Ready for Submission!

Once uploaded to GitHub, your repository will be ready for submission to the Cline community using the templates in SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md.

**Important**: Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username in all the commands and files!
