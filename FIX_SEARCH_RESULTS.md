# Fix: Getting Search Results from Your Custom Search Engine

## Current Status
âœ… **MCP Server is working perfectly!**
âœ… **API credentials are valid and configured**
âœ… **Both tools (`google_search` and `google_search_and_summarize`) are functional**

## Issue
Your Custom Search Engine is currently returning 0 results because it's configured to search specific sites rather than the entire web.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Access Your Search Engine Settings
1. Go to [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/)
2. Find your search engine "Web Search for MCP" 
3. Click **"Control Panel"** or **"Setup"**

### Step 2: Configure for Web Search
1. In the left sidebar, click **"Setup"** or **"Basics"**
2. Look for **"Sites to search"** section
3. **Remove any specific website URLs** that are listed
4. **Enable "Search the entire web"** option
5. OR add `*` as a site to search everything

### Step 3: Alternative Configuration
If you can't find the "Search the entire web" option:
1. Go to **"Setup"** > **"Sites to search"**
2. Add these popular sites for broader coverage:
   - `*.google.com`
   - `*.wikipedia.org`
   - `*.stackoverflow.com`
   - `*.github.com`
   - `*.medium.com`

### Step 4: Test the Fix
After making changes, test with:
```bash
cd google-search-mcp
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here" GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your_search_engine_id_here" node test-server.js
```

## Your MCP Server is Ready!

### Configuration File
Your `claude_desktop_config.json` is already set up with your credentials:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/admin/Development/Web/test_vs_ai/MCP/web-search/google-search-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your_google_api_key_here",
        "GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID": "your_search_engine_id_here"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Add to Claude Desktop
1. Copy the contents of `claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Add it to your Claude Desktop configuration
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. You'll have access to both search tools!
