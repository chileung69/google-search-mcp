**Subject**: New MCP Server: Google Search with Intelligent Summarization

**Why This Server is Awesome for Cline Users**:
🚀 **Transforms Cline into a web-connected super assistant** - bridges the gap between Cline's reasoning and real-time web information. Instead of being limited to training data, Cline can now access current events, latest documentation, troubleshooting solutions, and emerging trends.

🧠 **Intelligent, not just raw data** - provides both raw search results and smart summarization with key insights, domain grouping, and source attribution. Saves Cline from having to parse and organize search results.

💡 **Real-world benefits**:
- Code help: "Search for latest Next.js 14 patterns" - get current solutions
- Troubleshooting: "Find Docker M1 Mac issues" - access fresh community solutions  
- Research: "Summarize AI regulation developments" - organized insights from multiple sources
- Documentation: "Search Supabase deployment guide" - find current official docs

🛡️ **Production-ready reliability**:
- Official Google Custom Search JSON API (no scraping, no breaking)
- Smart error handling for rate limits and API failures
- Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive logging
- Clear error messages about API limits (100 free searches/day)

**Repository**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/google-search-mcp

**Installation**: `npx google-search-mcp` (after npm publish)

**Bottom Line**: This makes Cline dramatically more powerful by giving it access to the entire web while intelligently organizing results. It's like giving your AI assistant a research team.
